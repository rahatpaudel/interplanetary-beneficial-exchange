                <p class="virtual-text" id="virtual-1">One of the unique features of Venus is its pattern of sunrise and sunset. A day in Venus lasts 243 Earth days. So, sunrise and sunset from Venus are rare. The Sun also rises from the west and sets in the east. To witness this rare and unique moment, you can book a virtual tour. Tours can be booked for both sunrise and sunset. However, virtual tours are only available from places in the [Cytherean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytherean) valleys.</p>

                <p class="virtual-text" id="virtual-2">When the Sun's magnetic field interacts with the electrically excited ionosphere of Venus, it creates or induces, a magnetic field there. This induced magnetic field envelops the planet and is shaped like an extended teardrop, or the tail of a comet, as the solar wind blows past Venus and outward into the solar system. You can book a virtual tour to experience this online. The tour can be as long as an hour.</p>
