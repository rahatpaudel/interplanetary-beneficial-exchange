                In order to get to Venus, we want to use as little resources from the Earth as possible. Thus, the voyage from the Earth to Venus will take you 6 months (+- 10%). You will be travelling in the Cielo, a space shuttle. It is important to note that Venus is extremely hot and the pressure there is crushing. So, you will not be able to touch the Venus surface; you will have to be inside Cielo the entire time. Cielo will also be floating on Venus’ surface as landing on Venus is dangerous and complicated due to its terrain.

                    You will be travelling in a spiral trajectory, orbiting the Earth four times, accelerating each time at only one point, before setting off to Venus. Make sure you brace yourself for the times when the spacecraft will be accelerating while orbiting the Earth.

                    In the 6 months journey, you will enjoy a fascinating view of the Earth, its moon and the planets and heavenly bodies present. It will be a breathtaking sight. However, do not get so obsessed with clicking pictures of them, we suggest you enjoy the raw and majestic view with your eyes themselves. Pictures will be taken from the Cielo throughout your journey and you will be provided with them after your return to the Earth.

                    Venus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator. You will be taken to these places first on your tour to enjoy the view. 3 Earth days will be spent observing these areas

                    The shuttle will be hovering in the Maxwell Montes, a mountain higher than Mt. Everest, for one Earth day. The activities going on in the mountain can be observed. This mountain is located on the Northern hemisphere of Venus.

                    We will be landing in a way that we reach the side of Venus experiencing the Venusian night. So, due to the absence of the Sun’s light, stargazing from Venus would be possible. Sevel Earth day will be dedicated for this while we travel from the Northern hemisphere to the Southern hemisphere. We will be visiting the Eistla Regio after some time. It is located in the Southern hemisphere of Venus. There are volcanic activities happening in this region all the time. Energy to fuel the rocket will be extracted from this region for Ceilo’s remaining expenditure.

                    Next, for 1 Earth day, we will be spending time on the side of Venus experiencing the Venusian night. On that day, the Sun can be observed from Venus. If your timing is right, Mercury can also be seen.

                    Then, you will be returning to the Earth, now only taking 27 days, due to the abundance of fuel from Eistla Regio.
