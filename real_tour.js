venus = [
    "In order to get to Venus, we want to use as little resources from the Earth as possible. Thus, the voyage from the Earth to Venus will take you 6 months (+- 10%). You will be traveling in the Cielo, a space shuttle. It is important to note that Venus is extremely hot and the pressure there is crushing. So, you will not be able to touch the Venus surface; you will have to be inside Cielo the entire time. Cielo will also be floating on Venus’ surface as landing on Venus is dangerous and complicated due to its terrain.",
    "You will be traveling in a spiral trajectory, orbiting the Earth four times, accelerating each time at only one point, before setting off to Venus. Make sure you brace yourself for the times when the spacecraft will be accelerating while orbiting the Earth.",
    "In the 6 months journey, you will enjoy a fascinating view of the Earth, its moon and the planets and heavenly bodies present. It will be a breathtaking sight. However, do not get so obsessed with clicking pictures of them, we suggest you enjoy the raw and majestic view with your eyes themselves. Pictures will be taken from the Cielo throughout your journey and you will be provided with them after your return to the Earth.",
    "Venus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator. You will be taken to these places first on your tour to enjoy the view. 3 Earth days will be spent observing these areas",
    "The shuttle will be hovering in the Maxwell Montes, a mountain higher than Mt. Everest, for one Earth day. The activities going on in the mountain can be observed. This mountain is located on the Norther hemisphere of Venus.",
    "We will be landing in a way that we reach the side of Venus experiencing the Venusian night. So, due to the absence of the Sun’s light, stargazing from Venus would be possible. Sevel Earth day will be dedicated for this while we travel from the Northern hemisphere to the Southern hemisphere. We will be visiting the Eistla Regio after some time. It is located in the Southern hemisphere of Venus. There are volcanic activities happening in this region all the time. Energy to fuel the rocket will be extracted from this region for Ceilo’s remaining expenditure.",
    "Next, for 1 Earth day, we will be spending time on the side of Venus experiencing the Venusian night. On that day, the Sun can be observed from the Venus. If your timing is right, Mercury can also be seen.",
    "Then, you will be returning to the Earth, now only taking 27 days, due to the abundance of fuel from Eistla Region."

moon = [
    "The journey to Earth’s moon takes 7 Earth hours (+- 10%). The spacecraft taking passengers to the Moon are Chandra 78, Chandra 88 and Chandra 98. All of them are identical spacecraft.",
    "You will first land in the southern postal region of the Moon. Here, you will explore the land in which Chandrayaan-3, the first spacecraft to land on the Moon’s southern surface, landed on August 23, 2023. There is also a museum dedicated to this spacecraft in this region which will be explored by you on the first day of landing.",
    "You will also have options to explore the dark craters in the poles of the Moon and see the water harvesting technique used there. Both of the poles of the Moon have high concentrations of water ice so that technique can be observed in the North pole too.",
    "With too sparse an atmosphere to impede impacts, a steady rain of asteroids, meteoroids, and comets strikes the surface of the Moon, leaving numerous craters behind. You can book your tour accordingly to witness meteoroids hitting the lunar surface. Currently, 45 out of 365 tours to the moon are supposed to be in the timeline when the meteorite would be hitting the Moon. There will not be any harm associated with that as you will be in your spacecraft during the event.",
    "Next, we will be flying away to the north pole where you will witness sites of different historic events such as the landing of Apolo11 in the Sea of Tranquility in 1969 AD. If you looked in the right places on the Moon, you would find pieces of equipment, American flags, and even a camera left behind by astronauts.",
    "There will be a day spent at the Peary Crater where humans have made a few buildings. The crater floor itself is relatively flat which has made the building of a few architectures possible. You can walk (or rather bounce) through these architecture.",
    "A day will be dedicated to observe the technical water-harvesting technique used in the North Pole of the moon.",
    "You will return to the Earth on your 8th day of departure."

mars = [
    "As Earth and Mars orbit the Sun at different speeds and distances, once about every 26 months, they are aligned in a way that allows the most energy-efficient trip to Mars. This time, one can take a flight to Mars. The flight will take 4 months according to the current technology used. The spacecraft used would be the Falcon.",
    "On the way, the Martian Moons can be seen and other planets such as Jupiter can be seen. The asteroid belt will be visible for a long part of the journey. So, enjoy the view.",
    "The passengers will be able to witness different landing sites of rovers on the Martian surface such as the Curiosity rover, Perseverance Rover, Souvenir Rover, etc early on. The rovers that are inactive can be viewed and studied by the passengers. The working of current active rovers can also be witnessed by the passengers of the Falcon.",
    "One of the more intriguing features found on Mars is known as Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL). These features appear and fade in gullies and crater walls as the seasons and temperatures change on Mars. Recurring Slope Lineae (called RSL) are seasonally-repeating dark flows that are active at the warmest times of the year. This will be witnessed and the spacecraft will be sent to land in the winter region.",
    "Sulfates can be used to fertilize the lands to self-fertilize the lands of Mars. They can be obtained from the craters on Mars. Explorers will have time to explore the craters as well as fields in the Martian surface and even grow potatoes like Mark Watney did in 2015 (in a movie ……… haha).",
    "Olympus Mons will be a mining site from which energy from volcanoes will be harnessed to power life there and power the spacecrafts. On Mars, the crust remains stationary and the lava piles up in one, very large volcano. So, there will be an opportunity to witness the mining process and how the rockets and crafts can be fueled using energy from volcanoes. After fueling the spacecraft, we will be going to Mars’ moon Phobos.",
    "Measurements of the day and night sides of Phobos show such extreme temperature variations that the sunlit side of the moon rivals a pleasant winter day in Chicago, while only a few kilometers away, on the dark side of the moon, the climate is more harsh than a night in Antarctica. This will be witnessed by the passengers which would be a fun time.",
    "The Falcon will depart from Phobos and return to Earth. It will take 2 months to return back to the Earth due to the fuel used for the volcanoes.",

jupiter = [
    "Traveling to Jupiter will be done in the shuttle Europa Shuttle. It is because we cannot land on Jupiter; it is a gas giant. So, we will be landing on one of its moons, Europa. Along the way, we will witness the wonders of the asteroid belt and the many moons of Jupiter.",
    "We will be using the fuel from Earth and travel to Mars, taking 4 months. Then, fuel will be provided from the Olympus Mons and 1 more month will be needed to travel to Europa.",
    "In Europa, the conditions are just right for the passengers to ice-skate as it is made up of ice. Passengers can have an entertaining time doing that for an hour maximum.",
    "Scientists believe a saltwater ocean lies beneath Europa’s icy shell, holding twice as much water as Earth's global ocean, and possibly the chemical elements that are key ingredients to life. The mining and water-extraction processes can be witnessed by the passengers in Europa.",
    "Scientists that are working to understand the structure of Jupiter and the rings of Jupiter have settled on Europa. Their observations and findings can be studied by passengers on Europa to understand the giant planet better.",
    "The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 3 centuries. Passengers will have hands-on experience of the Great Red Spot and will be able to do astronomical observations of Jupiter from Europa. Polygonal arrangements of giant cyclonic storms at both of Jupiter’s poles – eight arranged in an octagonal pattern in the north and five arranged in a pentagonal pattern in the south, will be in view too.",
    "In addition to cyclones and anticyclones, Jupiter is known for its distinctive belts and zones – white and reddish bands of clouds that wrap around the planet. Strong east-west winds moving in opposite directions separate the bands. All of this can be witnessed from Europa in a clear way due to its proximity.",
    "After a pleasant trip, return to Earth will be done. On the way, the different asteroids will be toured and information about each of them will be provided."

saturn = [
    "From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries. As Saturn is also a gas giant, we will be going to its moons Titan and Enceladus. Firstly, we will take off from the Earth, land on Mars and gain more fuel and fire away to Titan. We will go on Phainon and our journey will take 6 months.",
    "While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet. So, by being very careful, passengers will also gain close proximity to Saturn’s rings. Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. This will also be witnessed in Saturn in close proximity.",
    "Haze-enshrouded Titan is Saturn’s largest moon and the solar system’s second-largest, and an all-around exceptional place. Titan is the only known world other than Earth where any sort of liquid collects on its surface. Cassini scientists found not only that liquid methane and ethane exist on Titan, but that they rain from the sky and fill liquid lakes, which are as wide as several hundred miles (or kilometers) and as deep as hundreds of feet (or meters). These regions will be studied and observed by the passengers and the works of the rovers will also individually be studied.",
    "Scientists that are working to understand the structure of Saturn and the rings of Saturn have settled on Titan. Their observations and findings can be studied by passengers on Titan to understand the planet better.",
    "Next, we will travel to Enceladus. Cassini scientists were astonished when they found a plume spraying water vapor, icy particles and simple organic materials into space from the south polar region of Enceladus. Scientists determined that the jets are the source of material for Saturn’s E-Ring. The jets spew out of great fissures, or cracks, known as “tiger stripes,” which Cassini scientists found grow wider or narrower depending on where Enceladus is in its orbit around Saturn. This will also be witnessed by the passengers.",
    "The moon Mimas, whose Herschel Crater makes it look like the Death Star from 'Star Wars', was thought to be an old, dead world, according to Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker. We will not travel to this moon but it can be observed in the inter-satellite travel.",
    "Hyperion is the only object in the solar system other than Earth’s moon that’s been confirmed as having a charged surface. Hyperion can’t boast any sort of atmosphere, but the tumbling, sponge-looking moon does build up a static charge, which scientists realized when Cassini passed through a beam of electrons coming up from the moon’s surface. Fun experiments can be conducted on Hyperion. All passengers will be part of the enjoyable experiments.",
    "After a successful journey, passengers will be brought back to Earth in 6 months."
